			<h1>About Us</h1>
		</header>
		<p>Our names are Brad and Ann-Jean Yuly. While we love to be near the ocean and enjoy the smells and sounds of the water, BAY is actually formed from the letters 			of our first names and last name. <br />
			<br />
			We got married in 2010 and are now venturing out officially in 2019 to provide “homegoods to your home”. We both grew up with mom’s who loved to bake and 				provide new home baked goods through the seasons. Since Ann-Jean also leaned to love baking, we decided to pass the goods on to those who don’t 				bake, don’t have time, or just aren’t very good at it. We would love to deliver a little of our home to yours.</p>
