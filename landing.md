			<h2>Who are we?</h2>
		</header>
		<p>Our names are Brad and Ann-Jean Yuly. While we love to be near the ocean and enjoy the smells and sounds of the water, BAY is actually formed from the letters of our first names and last name. <br />
			<br />
			We got married in 2010 and are now venturing out officially in 2019 to provide “homegoods to your home”. We both grew up with mom’s who loved to bake and provide new home baked goods through the seasons. Since Ann-Jean also leaned to love baking, we decided to pass the goods on to those who don’t bake, don’t have time, or just aren’t very good at it. We would love to deliver a little of our home to yours.</p>

					<h3>Frequently Asked Questions:</h3>  <!-- header title -->
				</header>
					<p>
					Why baked goods? Because we love to make and eat them. <br />
					Do you make other things than on the list? We are constantly trying new things and may try to sell them someday but for now we are 						sticking to our list of things we know. <br />
					Can we make requests? Yes, you can always make a request. We may or may not be able to accomodate and price will have to be negotiated.
